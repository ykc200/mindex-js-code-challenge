Dear Reviewers, 

First and foremost please allow me to thank you for taking time out of your day to review my coding challenge.

Testing has been done and all UI elements works as expected.
Given that I have never used the provided testing framework before, I have made a test plan and uploaded it to the repo.

I hope you have a wonderful day, and again thank you for your time and considerations.


Sincerely,

KeCheng Yu
